SSH keys basically helps us to keep our data secure.If my git gets hacked the hackers would at max get my SSHkeys and not access to commit in my repos directly!
Itâ€™s primary purpose is to secure remote private transactions over the internet by providing authentication on both the server-side and the client-side in order to establish an encrypted channel between both communicating parties.
