What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH keys are just plain text created using ssh-keygen, like passwords but they are more secure. Each SSH key pair includes two keys: public key that is copiedto the server and private key that remains with the user.
- You don't have to write your username and password everytime
- ssh keys are difficult to hack as these are very long.
