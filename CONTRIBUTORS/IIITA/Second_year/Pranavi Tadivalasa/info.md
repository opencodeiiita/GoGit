Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

- SSH keys comes in pairs, each pair is made up of : private key and a public key. 

- SSH (Secure socket shell) is simply a protocol which is used to securely log onto remote systems.

- One way to use SSH is through automatically generating public-private key pairs to simply encrypt a network connection, and then use password authentication to log on.

- SSH key allows us to fetch and push data without having to authorize using our gitHub password every time when we push or fetch it.
