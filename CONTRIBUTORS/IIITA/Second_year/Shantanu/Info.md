**Ques** - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

**Ans** - SSH keys are helpful so you don't have to write your username and password everytime you push to
	  github and authenticate it. The SSH key is randomly generated which makes it harder to crack.
	  It is also safer to use. The public key is used to encrypt a message whereas the private key is used to decrypt it.
          Decription can only be done by one with access to the private key.
