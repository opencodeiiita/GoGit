But in doing so you will face a problem.
I want that problem (you faced above) and the reason for that problem i.e. why you are facing that problem inside your info.md file.

## Ans:
The problem is after creating an empty directory in CONTRIBUTORS whenever I was trying to track that same empty folder through git status commands not able to track it not even able to push it to remote repository.

The reason for the same problem is that git doesn't include them in commits and it certainly doesn't include an empty directory when we push to GitHub.

## Que2(issue-409)  Is force push a good practice? Yes/No why? In most of the tasks on this repo, you used force push, so why this practice is Okay (neither good nor bad) in your case?
## Ans::
Force push is good or bad depending on the situation. In most tasks, we used force push in this repo because we are instructed to do tasks in 1 or 2 commits so to squash unnecessary commit and push it on GitHub we used force push. Force push is used when direct push is not possible and our commit history is not matching with remote repo commit history. But we need to keep all committed for future references.
