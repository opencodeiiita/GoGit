#### Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
SSH keys are just pairs of a public and private key. The Private keys are used to encrypt/decrypt the user identity. SSH keys provide more security as well as convinience to the user.

#### Ques - How to edit the last commit message in git?
There are two scenarios : 
1. Commit not pushed : For unpushed commit we can amend the new commit over the recent one. 
2. Commit pushed to remote repo : For pushed commit we cannot simply amend the commit and push the changes. For this case we need to force push the changes, using -f flag.
