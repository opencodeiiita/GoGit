Question: What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

Answer:  Secure Socket Shell (SSH) Key Management, is a special network protocol leveraging public-key cryptography to enable authorized users to remotely access a computer or other device via access credentials called SSH keys and without actually transmitting the password to the server.
        The advantage of using SSH keys is that we can be authenticated by the server without even entering our password. This is quite safe as even if someone tries to crack the password either by brute-force approach or by any other method, the chances are quite less because the actual password was never transmitted to the server.
        It is more convenient as if we use an SSH key with an SSH agent, we can connect to multiple servers without even entering the password for each system.
