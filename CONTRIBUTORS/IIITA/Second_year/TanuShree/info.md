SSH keys are a pair<public key, private key> of keys which is used for authentication.
Private key remains on the user system and is used to decrypt information exchanged in SSH protocol whereas public key is used to encrypt information , it can be shared and can be used by both user and remote.
Advantage : 
SSH keys are safer and easier to use since we don't need to enter password (which is more probable to get hacked) and also, it is considered safer because it is difficult to hack.
