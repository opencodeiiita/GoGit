### Issue 223: <br>
#### What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it? <br>
SSH Keys are <br>
- authentication credentials that manage the connection between local and remote systems. 
- like passwords, but more secure & don't require you to enter your username and password everytime.
- come in pairs of a private key and a public key.
For instance, my GitHub SSH Keys secure the connection between my local systems and my GitHub (remote).
