## Issue_Description:
  - Must be a well define git task which is not covered in any existing issue.
  - Task should be described in a detailed manner so that anyone can understand that.
  - Must provide some content that the contributor can commit while solving the task like it can be a question which a contributor can answer and able to make a commit.

## Label:
  - Only add `under review` label to it, don't try to add any other label. Points will be assigned to it only after its varification by the mentor.

## Important point:
  - In the begining, you may found that there are several issues which can be made, but I have lots of issues in my list that will be released time to time as the program
   forwards, so your issue can be rejected on this basis too.
