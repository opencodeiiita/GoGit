Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

Ans: Whenever we work on any Github repo we would often need to identify ourselves to Github and are required to enter username and password frequently.
So SSH keys is an alternative way of authenticating secure connections and would save our time from entering the same credentials again and again.
SSH keys comes in pair of private key (which is stored in our system) and public key(that is shared). For simple understanding we can think them as a key-lock pair. So whenever the keys matches we are allowed to make changes.
As the passwords in the conventional method are sent over the network, but SSH key authentication does not involves this. Thus, it provides additional security.
