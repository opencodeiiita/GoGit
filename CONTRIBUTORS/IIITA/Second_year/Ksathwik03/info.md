Ques - How and why merge conflicts arise? 
Ans - A merge conflict arises when two branches both modify the same line(s) of a file and are subsequently merged. Git can't know which of the changes to keep, and merge conflict arises.

Ans - This above type of merge is fast forward merge because there are no commits made on main branch after commiting in branch-1 when there are commits made on master branch after commiting on branch-1 then recursive merge occurs and there might be some merge conflicts.
