Ques: What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it ?
Ans: Everytime adding username and password in gitbash is a hectic process, by adding ssh cloning no longer needs us to enter username and password again, thus saves our time and efforts.
SSH is a private key that is stored in out local system by with it identifies the user and allows to make changes. It also adds extra levels of security which makes it harder to hack and increases safety.
