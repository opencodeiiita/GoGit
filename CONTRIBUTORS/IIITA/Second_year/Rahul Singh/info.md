Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
Ans - SSH keys are access credentials that are used in the SSH protocol, which is used to remotely login from one system to another.

Advantage of using it are that SSH keys are very secure and the chances of the network getting compromised are very low. Also they are very common and therefore many organizations already use them.
