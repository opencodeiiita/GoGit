### What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH Keys basically provides a way of transferring encoded data over network. We use ssh keys generally accessing remote servers.
SSH uses some encryption and description algorithms by which it becomes very secure and safe to use. 
Username and Password can be altered or stolen but SSH keys can not because of its encryption and description techniques.
SSH keys setup is done using two keys one is public and another is private (private key is stored locally on our computer).
while accessing the remote server, Public key (on remote) and private key interact and then secure permission is allowed which is way safer than using username and password to access remote server.
And after generating SSH keys and setting it up, we need not to enter our username and password everytime we clone any repository.
