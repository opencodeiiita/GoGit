Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH keys helps us to avoid writing username and password every single time when you push any change to github and authenticate it.
SSH keys are generated in pairs, a public key and a private key.
Public keys are the one that gets shared and a private key is the one that is stored only on your computer. If the keys match, you're granted access.
Basicaaly it is not only convenient but is also more secure.
