Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?<br>
SSH keys are an authentication method used to gain access to an encrypted connection between systems and uses that connection to manage the remote system and cloud infrastructure. 
In other words A pair of encryption a private key and a public key are generated which are mathematically linked to each other:
       The public key is used to encrypt a message whereas the private key is used to decrypt it. 
       Decription can only be done by one with access to the private key. 
The SSH protocol uses keys for authentication in two ways:
       1. Authenticating users
       2. Authenticating servers
