#### Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
SSH keys are just pairs of a public and private key. The Private keys are used to encrypt/decrypt the user identity. SSH keys provide more security as well as convinience to the user. While using SSH keys the user don't need to provide password every time, he can be authenticated using the SSH keys.
