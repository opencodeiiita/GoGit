What do you really understand from SSH keys?
SSH is a remote administration protocol that allows users to modify their remote servers over the Internet. This service was created as a replacement of Telnet and uses some techniques to ensure that all communications are in a encrypted manner.

What are the advantages of using it?
1. SSH can protect a network from attacks such as IP spoofing, IP source routing effectively.
2. SSH gives encryption from data transfer that restricts hackers from hacking your server password and user information.
