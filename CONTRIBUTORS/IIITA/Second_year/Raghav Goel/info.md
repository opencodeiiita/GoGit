What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH key is a method that can be used for authentication different from normal passwords mainly in the way it operates. 
SSH keys are more long than typically used passwords and are computer generated, making them less prone to hacking. 
 They are not stored on servers, but only the device which is being used for login, hence again
making it less vulnerable to hacking.
