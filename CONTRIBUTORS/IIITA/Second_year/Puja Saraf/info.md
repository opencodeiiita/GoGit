## Hello there!!!

### I am Puja Saraf.

While working on a repository, SSH key can be used to identify ourself without using github username and password.




When we try to log in, server checks the public key and generates a random string and encrypts it using the public key.

And it could be decrypted only with corresponding private key (which is on our computer). Now our computer decrypts it and send the message back to the server.




And for security reasons it also acts as a password so that no third party could push changes to the repo.
