But in doing so you will face a problem.
I want that problem (you faced above) and the reason for that problem i.e. why you are facing that problem inside your info.md file.

## Ans:
The problem is after creating an empty directory in CONTRIBUTORS whenever I was trying to track that same empty folder through git status commands not able to track it not even able to push it to remote repository.

The reason for the same problem is that git doesn't include them in commits and it certainly doesn't include an empty directory when we push to GitHub.


## Que(issue-223):
What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

## Ans:

SSH is Secure Shell Protocol. It allow us to connect remote computer by using text based interface. Using ssh we can log into another compter and perform any commands on that computer securely. It provide secure connection between two host in insecure network.In terms of github, github is server side computer and aur local system is a client server. Using ssh key we make secure connection between the same host and they mainly comes in pair one is public and other one is private.
