What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH keys are just plain text created using ssh-keygen, like passwords but they are more secure. Each SSH key pair includes two keys: public key that is copied to the server and private key that remains with the user.
We don't have to write your username and password everytime
ssh keys are almost impossible to hack.

How to edit last commit message using git?
The git commit --amend command allows you to change the most recent commit message.
