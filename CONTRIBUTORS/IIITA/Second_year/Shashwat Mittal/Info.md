Ques-What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
ssh keys are used for authentication. They help to connect to github without without using your password or credentials any time. I grants access to multiple users without sharing the password.
It consists of a public and private key where the private key stored in the system is never revealed to server or any other user.
