What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH key is a kind of networking protocol, that digs a secure tunnel between the host and the server. It's a two way channel(Secured Shell) that is meant by the exchange of data, in the form of cryptogenically key(4096 bits)
used to encrypt it(by using public key:- Which is acceible to everyone) and decrypt(only by the private key:- which is accessible to only host and the server) so that the info. between them got secured, and pass through secured channel
And make it free from hacking or data leakage between them by any malicious effect.
