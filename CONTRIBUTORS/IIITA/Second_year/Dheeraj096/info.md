Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?


Ans  - Basically from my understanding SSH keys are secure alternate to email and password like we don't have to write everytime email and password for authentication. SSH key  is automated for implementing single sign-on system method. It comes in pairs <public and private>  public key -  sharing with github. private key - stays on local machine. As when both keys matches we are allowed to make changes.

  Advantage:-
  
  SSH keys are much securer and easier because we don't have to write anything email and password. Also there is no chance of spelling mistake.
  
  It easily identify yourself no one can identify our private informations like password.
