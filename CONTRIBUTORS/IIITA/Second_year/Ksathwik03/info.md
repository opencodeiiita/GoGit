Ques - Above, I told you to merge branch-1 into main, tell me which type of merge is this and why? Also, explain it too.

Ans - This above type of merge is fast forward merge because there are no commits made on main branch after commiting in branch-1 when there are commits made on master branch after commiting on branch-1 then recursive merge occurs and there might be some merge conflicts.
