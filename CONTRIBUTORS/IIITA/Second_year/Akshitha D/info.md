Q.What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
From my understanding SSH(Secure shell) Keys can connect Github and local system without entering your username and password everytime. 
Generally it comes in pairs public and private key.
Advantages:
It is an alternative way to verify our identity without entering password and username everytime. 
SSH keys are helpful to clone the repo without entering the password.
The cryptography behind SSH keys ensure that no one can hack them making them more secure than passwords.
