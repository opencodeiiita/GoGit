Q.What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
    - Using SSH key we can clone repo without entering USERNAME and PASSWORD.
    - Unlike password SSH key not sent to sever only stored in system
    - Due to its length more complex for brute-force attacks
    - it secure the connection between local machine and github(remote) & SSH key more secure than pasword.
