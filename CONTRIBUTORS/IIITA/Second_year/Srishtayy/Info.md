Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

Ans)   A SSH key is a substitute way of distinguishing yourself that doesn't expect you to enter you username and secret phrase without fail. SSH keys come two by two, a public key that gets imparted to administrations like GitHub, and a private key that is put away just on your PC. On the off chance that the keys match, you are given access.

Advantages:
1) SSH keys are use for safe and secure access.
2) We do not have to enter log in credentials manually.
3) SSH also protects against attacks trying to gain access to remote machines.
