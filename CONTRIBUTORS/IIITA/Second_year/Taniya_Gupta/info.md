Q. What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
SSH is a Secure SHell. Secure as it sends 'encrypted data' between client and the server.
The system can be accessed remotely using SSH cryptography.
It is basically made or being used to increase the security as it contains two SSH key pairs and can connect with the server without any password login but the SSH key pairs namely public and private make the SSH authentication secure.
While cloning with https, git require password everytime, but with SSH, it seems to be more secure than HTTPS as it does not use password-based authentication.
