Hi! This is Juhie Chandra!
I am from NITJ Second Year ICE.


I have recently created clone of the repo using SSH key! 

1. What are SSH Key?
An SSH key is a network protocol access credential for the SSH. This secure network protocol, which is authenticated and encrypted, is used for remote communication between devices over an unprotected open network. Unprotected open network may include any remote server etc. It generates a link between client and server through private and public key. A private key is stored at client side and a public key is stored on server side. Private key acts as a key to the lock (Public key).

2. What are advantages?
  It is a secure way to access remote servers.
  It securely transmit data files.
  Also safely issues remote commands.
