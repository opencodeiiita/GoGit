**Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?** <br/>
An SSH key is an alternate way to identify yourself that doesn't require you to enter your username and password every time. <br/>
SSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on your computer. <br/>

Main advantages -  
- SSH removes the burden of authenticating on the remote server repeatedly for every action that you do. 
- Using SSH saves a lot of time since the user does not enter credentials every time.
