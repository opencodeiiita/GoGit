What is SSH and its advantages?
-SSH stands for Secure Shell is a method/protocol through which we can remotely access our systems. In Github it allows our PC to be recognised by Github so we dont have to enter our username and password again and again. We just generate a key pair.The private key is stored in our system and is only known to us allowing our system access. Earlier I used https for cloning ad it asked for password everytime while ssh has made the process faster and smoother.
