Q. What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH keys are an access credential that is used in the SSH protocol, like in traditional methods we use passwords for authentication but authentication with SSH keys is little more complex, but helps to increase security when logging into an SFTP server.
SSH keys are more difficult to hack than passwords and thus are more secure.
