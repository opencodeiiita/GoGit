ans-1 : it arises when git cannot merge changes automatically. like while doing the cherry-pick task, we faced merge conflicts because while cherry-picking we changes the text in the same lines and git cannot understand which change to  preserve while merging.

#### Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?
SSH keys are just pairs of a public and private key. The Private keys are used to encrypt/decrypt the user identity. SSH keys provide more security as well as convinience to the user.

#### Ques - How to edit the last commit message in git?
There are two cases : 
1. Changes not pushed : If changes are not pushed we can simply add --amend flag and it will amend last commit. 
2. Changes are pushed : If Changes are pushed we need to --amend the and also force push the changes using the -f flag

## Issue : 366
First commit. We will go to the file state in first commit and checkout to new branch. then we will come to master and hard reset to the previous branch head.




ans-2 : yes. force pushing is bad practice. while doing the task we were only changing our file like for my case, i was only changing my info.md file. Therefore it didn't affect others data. 






















ans-3 : I think the git bisect isn't used in any task.
