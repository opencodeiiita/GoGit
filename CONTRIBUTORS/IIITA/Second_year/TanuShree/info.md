Ques 1 - Why would one ever need to ever reorder his commits?
ans) We need to reorder commits in order to improve git history for better understanding. We can reorder commits by using interactive rebase since this allows to rewrite git history.

Ques - 1 Why do we do fetch before the merge or pull?
ans - Using git pull, all the changes are made to our local repo without letting us check those codes before merge.But, if we use git fetch, then we would be able to review the changes before merging. So, this is why we use fetch before merge.


answer1) Merge conflicts arise when there are conflicting changes on the same region of file / same lines, because git can't distinguish which one to keep and which to remove.

SSH keys are a pair<public key, private key> of keys which is used for authentication.
Private key remains on the user system and is used to decrypt information exchanged in SSH protocol whereas public key is used to encrypt information , it can be shared and can be used by both user and remote.
Advantage : 
SSH keys are safer and easier to use since we don't need to enter password (which is more probable to get hacked) and also, it is considered safer because it is difficult to hack.
Ans1->app
How to edit commit message:-

1)If the commit has not been pushed:-
 you can amend the commit message with the git commit --amend command.
2)If the commit is pushed:Follow the above steps and use -push --force.
Ans2->Coding in Flow, CodingWithMitch, etc.

answer2) No, force push is not a good practice because it may overwrite any changes made by some other person pushing in the meantime. When we did our tasks, this practice was okay beacuse we were working on our own repo.

answer3) git mv - to rename a git file, git submodules.

ans) If we have written all the 3 answers at the end then we would have only one hunk to edit instead of two and we have had to make changes three times.

Ques - 3 Does the merge conflicts come when you applied your stashes? Why/Why not?
ans - No, I haven't got any merge conflicts since I've included Ques-1 at the start of file and Ques-3 at the end of file.

Ques 2 - What are Git Submodules? Why are they used?
ans) Git submodules lets us clone another repository into our project and keep commits separate. The .gitmodules file created, contains meta data about the mapping between the submodule project's URL and local directory.
