## Title of the commit:
	Commit message - <X+1>
	
## Description of the commit:
	An appropriate message that desccribes the changes you performed in this commit.
	
## Important points (don't include these points in your commit message, these are just for your information). 
- **X** : This is just a number present in the title of the latest commit inside main branch.
- Visit <a href = "https://github.com/ABHAY0O7/GoGit/commits/main">here</a> to check the latest commit with value of "X" and also see that most of the commit's done by me follows commit template, so you can also take hint from there. ðŸ˜„ 
- **Try to complete the task in minimum possible commits. Unnecessary commits may leads to PR rejection.**
- **If your PR has more than one commit, then each commit's title number ie X should be increase by 1 as compare to previous commit's X**
- **If you are working on a task and in that time period if the upstream got updated then you must sync your PR with the latest upstream commit following the value of "X".
 Ex:- Suppose upstream is at X = 5, and you completed a task with commits X = 6 and 7, but in that time period someone else completed a task and upstream got updated with
 commit X = 6, then you must update your commits to X = 7 and 8.<br>
 PS : This can be done easily by editing the commit message**
